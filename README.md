Steps of the Lab
The project was updated using the Maven POM file, and dependencies were synchronized and updated successfully. This ensured that the build process started with all necessary configurations in place. A jar file was successfully generated during the build process. The main class was specified within the jar file to facilitate its execution, ensuring that the output was functional and aligned with the requirements. Files required for the build process were carefully moved to appropriate directories. This organization ensured smooth execution and prevented potential errors caused by misplaced files. An HTML file was generated as part of the process, serving as a key output for validating the software build process. This file provided a visual representation of the build outcomes.
A detailed project report was created to document the outcomes and issues faced during the process. This report captured critical information about the workflow and the resolution of encountered problems. Initial build attempts encountered errors due to missing configurations or dependencies. These issues were systematically resolved, leading to successful builds and emphasizing the importance of debugging and troubleshooting. A jar file was generated without errors and executed as expected. This confirmed the stability and correctness of the build process after resolving initial challenges. Tests for binaryTest.java were executed, with all tests passing successfully. This result ensured the reliability and functionality of the tested components. The design part of the lab involved inputting two binary numbers and calculating the addition, AND, OR, and multiplication operations. Moreover below are screenshots of the lab for each step completed.
